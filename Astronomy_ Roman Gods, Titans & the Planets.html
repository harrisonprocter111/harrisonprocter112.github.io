			<h4><center><font color="white">Neptune is one of the biggest planets in our solar system. It is seventeen times bigger than that of our planet. Neptune is also the eighth farthest planet from oue sun, being a wopping two point eight billion miles away from the thing at the center of our solar sytem. While Earth only has one moon, Neptune has thirteen moons and growing. Neptune is very heavy, its is 13 times heavier than Earth. Even though Neptune has greater mass, the gravity on Neptune is nearly the same that it is on Earth. Neptune is the coldest planet in the solar system. Even though the person who officially found Neptune is not known, Neptune was the first planet to be found by mathmatical calculations. Neptune has very big storms, one taken by a space probe was even the size of Earth. The amount of time it takes Neptune to make one orbit around the sun is one hundred and sixty five years. Sometimes Pluto enters Neptunes orbit for twenty year periods, but the two planets can never collide because they are too far apart and to great a distance apart. Overall Neptune is a very interesting and unique planet and will continue to be for the remainder of human time.</font></center></h4>

			<h4><center><font color="white">Neptune is the Roman God of the ocean in Roman times. He is mostly pictured with a trident and fish, although he is sometimes pictured with horses because he is also the god of horses. When the Romans took over Greece they took most of the Greek ideas and gave them new names. The thing they recycled Neptune from was Poseidon, the Greek god of the ocean. According to the legends, Neptune was the son of the Earth and Saturn who was the Roman sky god. Since Saturn was scared that his sons and daughters would overthrow him, he decided to swallow them all including Neptune. They were all saved when Neptune's mother tricked Saturn into eating a giant stone who he thought was his son Jupiter. Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars (Mars being the god of jewels and death) overthrew Saturn and took control of his kingdom. In mythology, Neptune was pictured as being mean and ill-tempered. The Romans made him this way because the ocean was often in a storm, so they incorperated this into the god. In Rome they did not respect Neptune as much as Jupiter or Mars, but they still made him two temples so that he would not get angry and give them bad fortune with water. Even though he was not respected, Neptune played a key role in Roman mythology and will be a used story for years to come.</font></center></h4>
